Embedded Systems Development Task for xiot Internship

 The circuit:
  - LED attached from pin 13 to ground
  - pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
  - 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground
  - Analog sensor LM-35 
        attach Power Pin 1 to +5V
        attach Data  pin 2 to Analog In / A0
        attach Power Pin 3 to ground
  
  - Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
    attached to pin 13.
